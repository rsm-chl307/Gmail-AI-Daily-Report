# Gmail-AI-Daily-Report
A Google Apps Script that summarizes daily Gmail inbox activity using Gemini, detects interview invitations, and sends immediate alerts.

# Gmail Daily Report with Gemini (Google Apps Script)

## Overview

This project is a **Google Apps Script** that automatically summarizes your daily Gmail inbox using **Google Gemini**.  
It is designed primarily for **job seekers** who receive a large volume of emails (job alerts, application confirmations, system notifications, interview invitations, etc.) and want to **avoid missing important messages**, especially interview-related emails.

The script:
- Scans your Gmail inbox once per day
- Classifies emails using Gemini
- Sends a **human-readable daily summary**
- Sends an **immediate alert** if a confirmed interview invitation is detected

This repository is intended for **demonstration and portfolio purposes**.  
OAuth configuration, API keys, and triggers are intentionally omitted for security reasons.

## Why This Exists (Problem Statement)

When actively job hunting, inboxes tend to fill up with:
- Automated application confirmations
- Job alerts from multiple platforms
- Account verification emails
- Occasional but critical interview invitations

Important emails can easily get buried.  
This script acts as a **daily decision-support tool**, answering a simple question every morning:

> **“Did I receive anything today that requires immediate action?”**

---

## Key Features

- **Daily Gmail summary** (human-readable, no raw JSON)
- **Immediate alert** for confirmed interview invitations
- **Confidence-based classification**
  - Low-confidence items are flagged as *Needs Review*
- **Batch processing** to prevent truncated LLM outputs
- **No hardcoded secrets**
  - Uses Script Properties for configuration
- Designed for **production-like reliability**, not just experimentation

## Setup Notes (High-Level)

> Detailed deployment steps are intentionally omitted.

To deploy this script yourself, you will need to:

1. Create a **Google Apps Script** project
2. Paste the script into the editor
3. Apply the required configuration via **Script Properties**
4. Set a **time-driven trigger** (e.g., daily at 7–8 AM)

---

## Required Configuration

This script expects the following **Script Properties** to be set manually:

### Required

| Property Name | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Your Gemini API key (obtain from Google AI Studio) |
| `GEMINI_MODEL` | A Gemini model that supports `generateContent` (e.g. `models/gemini-2.5-flash`) |

> API keys must **never** be hardcoded into the script.

---

## Obtaining a Gemini API Key

1. Go to **Google AI Studio**
2. Create or select a project
3. Generate an API key
4. Ensure the project has access to a Gemini model that supports text generation
5. Set the key in Apps Script → **Project Settings → Script Properties**

---

## Daily Report Output (Example)

Below is an example of the **daily summary email** generated by the script:

This format allows you to understand the day’s inbox status in seconds.

---

## Immediate Interview Alerts

If the script detects a **confirmed interview invitation** (above a confidence threshold), it will:
- Label the email in Gmail
- Send an **immediate alert email**
- Include key details such as company, position, urgency, and proposed times

This ensures interview-related messages are **never missed**, even outside the daily summary window.

---

## Intended Use

- Personal productivity
- Job search inbox management
- Demonstration of:
  - LLM integration
  - Workflow automation
  - Defensive engineering for LLM outputs
  - Production-minded script design

---

## Security & Privacy

- No credentials are stored in the repository
- OAuth flows are handled by Google Apps Script
- API keys are stored only in Script Properties
- This repository contains **code only**, not user data

---

## Disclaimer

This project is provided for **demonstration purposes** only.  
It is not an officially supported Google product and is not intended for multi-user deployment without further hardening.

---

## Author Notes

This script reflects real-world concerns encountered when deploying LLM-powered automations:
- Output truncation
- Structured parsing reliability
- Clear separation between logic and configuration
- Human-readable reporting over raw logs

It is intentionally designed to be **simple to understand**, yet **robust enough to run unattended**.
